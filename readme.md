# What's the point?

This project consists of two independent applications. 

## Linear clock

The linear clock is another way of looking at time. The application displays a total of 48 vertical bars that change colour as the day progresses. Each bar represents a half-hour slot.

(It is currently 3:16pm at the time of this screenshot and the day's program is empty)

It is possible to prioritise the window, i.e. to prevent a window being placed above it. Ideal for placing in the corner of the screen. You can also import a typical day to display it.

It is also possible to change the colour code of the day's programme and give time slots a certain colour.


## Day programme modifier

Application for modifying/creating a daily programme. When you launch the application, you need to have the default_color_palette.txt file in the same file.

To use the application, simply click on one of the colours in the colour selector and then click on the time slot you want to modify. You can also change the background colour, which is displayed when nothing is changed and the time has not yet arrived. 

It is also possible to change the colour of the bar fill in unmodified time slots. Use the range to delete a colour.

It is also possible to import a colour palette as the default. The file consists of a series of 10 rgb codes separated by a line break. Use the default palette as an example.

# Example

Here's an example of what a programme looks like from one application to another.
